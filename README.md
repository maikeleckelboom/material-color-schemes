# Material Schemes Library

A lightweight library that simplifies creating Material Design themes and color schemes for your apps or websites. It
works seamlessly
with [@material/material-color-utilities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material/material-color-utilities), providing
an extra layer of flexibility by generating complete, coordinated, and accessible color palettes from just a single
color.

Engineered for practical workflows, the library offers core functionsâ€”`createScheme`, `createTheme`, and `createPalette`
â€”that quickly produce cohesive color systems (`DynamicScheme`, `Theme`, and `TonalPalette` instances). The
`createColorScheme` method then transforms these into production-ready color schemes for your project.

## Installation

Material Schemes requires `@material/material-color-utilities` as a peer dependency.

```bash
npm install @material/material-color-utilities material-schemes
```

## API Overview

### `createScheme`

**Purpose:** Generates a dynamic color scheme from a source color or a complete options object.

- **Usage with a source color:**

  ```javascript
  const scheme = createScheme(0xff0000, { isDark: true });
  ```

    - **Parameters:**
        - `sourceColor`: A hex color (for example, `0xff0000` for red).
        - `options` (optional): Includes settings like `isDark`, `variant`, or `contrastLevel`.

- **Usage with an option object:**

  ```javascript
  const scheme = createScheme({
    sourceColor: 0x00ff00,
    secondary: 0x0000ff,
    isDark: true
  });
  ```

    - **Returns:** A `DynamicScheme` object containing color keys like `primary`, `onPrimary`, etc.

**Note:**  
Providing only a `sourceColor` or `primary` lets the library auto-generate a comprehensive set of color palettes. You
can use
`createScheme` directly for single-scheme control or let `createTheme` handle full theme generation.

### `createTheme`

**Purpose:** Creates a complete Material Design theme, including light and dark variants with customizable palettes.

- **Usage with a source color:**

  ```javascript
  const theme = createTheme(0xff0000, { contrastLevel: ContrastLevel.HIGH });
  ```

    - **Parameters:**
        - `sourceColor`: A hex color (for example, `0xff0000`).
        - `options` (optional): Options such as `variant` or `contrastLevel`.

- **Usage with an option object:**

  ```javascript
  const theme = createTheme({
    sourceColor: 0x00ff00,
    variant: Variant.EXPRESSIVE,
    primary: 0xff0000 // Override
  });
  ```

    - **Returns:** A `Theme` object that includes both light and dark schemes, along with custom palettes.

**Under the Hood:**  
`createTheme` calls `createScheme` twice (for light and dark) to form a complete theme in one step.

---

## Tips

- **Color Input:** Use either hex strings (like `#FF0000`) or numbers (like `0xff0000`).
- **Getting Started:**
    - Use `createTheme` if you want a full theme generated automatically.
    - Use `createScheme` for more granular control over a single color scheme.

## Alignment with Official Material Design

This library closely mirrors the official Material Design package, while addressing the fact that there isnâ€™t a
maintained TypeScript version available. Updates to the official implementation may require corresponding changes here
to stay compatible.

- **Versioning & Compatibility:** Uses semantic versioning; major updates may introduce breaking changes.
- **Community Collaboration:** Contributions, issue reports, and feedback are welcome to help maintain quality and
  alignment.

---

## Motivation

During my personal projects, I found that a robust solution for creating Material Design themes and color schemes was
missing. This library was built to complement the official Material Design package as a peer dependency and provide a
more integrated experience.

### Why Choose This Library?

- **Enhanced API:** Provides a high-level interface for crafting color schemesâ€”something the official library lacks.
- **Filling the Gaps:** Many alternative npm packages do not fully implement the latest Material Design specs or offer
  comprehensive functionality.
- **CLI Support:** Generate color schemes directly from the terminal with the integrated command-line interface.
- **Community Driven:** Open to contributions and pull requests, ensuring ongoing improvement and closer alignment with
  evolving standards.
- **Built on Experience:** Developed from first-hand experience using Material Designâ€™s intuitive color system in
  various projects.

### ðŸ§­ Positioning

This library fills a key gap in the Material Design ecosystem: a modern, TypeScript-native tool for generating color
schemes with a high-level API and CLI support. While official utilities like `material-color-utilities` provide
low-level building blocks, and `material-kolor` serves Kotlin developers, there's been no ergonomic solution tailored
for JavaScript/TypeScript workflowsâ€”until now. Designed to complement the official packages, this library offers a more
complete and developer-friendly experience, with full support for community contributions.
